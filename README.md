# School_District_Analysis - Module 4 -PyCity Schools 

## Overview

The PyCity School District has asked for an analysis of their school district that consists of 15 schools.  They would like a high-level view of the districtâ€™s key metrics in a format that is easily presented in a table format.  They would like the following metrics to be represented:

      -Top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
      -The average math score received by students in each grade level at each school
      -The average reading score received by students in each grade level at each school
      -School performance based on the budget per student
      -School performance based on the school size 
      -School performance based on the type of school  
      
As we began our analysis, we were notified of evidence of academic dishonesty amongst the ninth graders at the Thomas High School and we were forced to adjust out data  So the data has discounted the math and reading schools for ninth grade of Thomas High School only.

# Analysis

The analysis utilized two files: schools_complete.CSV and students_complete.csv provided by the district.  The data was reviewed and filtered into DataFrames through Jupyter Notebook, utilizing PythonData and Panada. The systems allowed us to take multiple layers of data and slice and dice it into various outputs for the PyCity School District.

## Results

The first 4 district metrics were minimally affected by the change in the data, due to the Thomas High School academic dishonesty in the following manner.

    - The top 5 and bottom 5 schools changed  with the changes Thomas High School % overall passing going from 65.1% t0 90.6%
    - Average math score by grade did not change for anyone except for the 9th graders in Thomas High School
    - Average reading score by grade did not change for anyone except for the 9th graders in Thomas High School

## Scored by School Spending, Size and Type

There was no noticeable change in the scores from the original data to the new data. This could be due to the formatting of the scores and percentages to the tenth.  If we have to go out father than a tenth decimal place, the change is not scientifically significant enough for the district to be concerned.

# Summary
 
The changes to the district after the math and reading scores were replaced were as follows:
    1. Budget per student changed at Thomas High school due to less students in the overall calculation, roughly 461 less.
    2. Overall Passing actually went up for Thomas High School by removing the 9th Grades
    3. % passing for reading went down slightly from 97.30% to 93.15%
    4. The data for the any other analysis this year or any year over year will continue to carry the issues of Thomas High School        9th grades since there scores all read Nan now.
